Adds "Fork me on Github" ribbons to your WordPress posts

## Description ##

Github Ribbons is a WordPress Plugin that allows you to add "Fork me on Github" ribbons to your WordPress posts or pages. You can enable the ribbon per post/page level or at global level.

### Features
The following are some of the features of the Plugin

- You can choose between image based ribbons or CSS3 based ribbons.
- You can choose whether to show the ribbon on the right side or on the left side.
- You can choose any one of the 6 different colours that are available.
- Configuration can be set either globally or on a post by post basic.

### Styling using CSS

If you want to style the ribbon yourself or add additional CSS styles to it (like adding `z-index` etc) then add it to the `.robbon-holder` CSS class.

### Development

The development of the Plugin happens over at [github][6]. If you want to contribute to the Plugin, fork the [project at github][6] and send me a pull request.

If you are not familiar with either git or Github then refer to this [guide to see how fork and send pull request](http://sudarmuthu.com/blog/contributing-to-project-hosted-in-github).

If you are looking for ideas, then you can start with one of the following TODO items :)

### TODO

The following are the features that I am thinking of adding to the Plugin, when I get some free time. If you have any feature request or want to increase the priority of a particular feature, then let me know.

- Add an ability to translate the text used inside the ribbon
